Troubleshooting and Workarounds
Issue: Locating the 'Success!' Element

Challenge:
During automation, locating the 'Success!' element within the body of the document has been problematic due to its dynamic timing or behavior. This issue prevents reliable verification of success messages.

Potential Solutions:

Use innerText:

Description: Utilize the innerText property to directly verify the text content of elements. This can help in identifying and asserting the presence of the 'Success!' message.

Example:

const successMessage = await page.locator('selector-for-success-message').innerText();
expect(successMessage).toContain('Success!');

Fix the Message in the HTML:

Description: Modify the HTML to display a fixed 'Success!' message or add a specific class or ID for the success message. This approach can make the element easier to locate and verify.

Example:
html

<!-- HTML modify-->
<div id="success-message">Success!</div>


// Verify code
const successMessage = await page.locator('#success-message').innerText();
expect(successMessage).toBe('Success!');
